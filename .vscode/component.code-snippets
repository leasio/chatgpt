  // Place your c workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and
  // description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope
  // is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is
  // used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
  // Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "component": {
    "prefix": "com",
    "body": [
      "import React from \"react\";",
      "import css from \"@styled-system/css\";",
      "import {useLocation, useHistory, useParams, Link, NavLink} from \"react-router-dom\";",
      "import {Button} from \"antd\";",
      "import request from \"@/utils/request\";",
      "",
      "export interface $1Props {",
      "  name?: string;",

      "",
